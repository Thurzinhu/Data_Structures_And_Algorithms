# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the C programming language. The purpose of this collection is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding fundamental data structures and algorithms, as well as to serve as a reference for implementing these concepts in C.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
- Implementation of dynamic and static arrays.
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### Linked Lists
- Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### Stacks
- Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- Operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

### Trees
- Implementation of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees.
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, rebalance, rotations, find, etc.
