# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the C programming language. The purpose of this collection is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding fundamental data structures and algorithms, as well as to serve as a reference for implementing these concepts in C.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
- Implementation of dynamic and static arrays.
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### Linked Lists
- Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### Stacks
- Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- Operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

### Queues
- Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- Types: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, and Priority Queue.
- Operations: enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty.

### Trees
- Implementation of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and heaps.
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).

### Heaps
- Implementation of min-heap and max-heap.
- Operations: insertion, deletion, heapify.

### Graphs
- Implementation using adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
- Operations: addEdge, removeEdge, and traversal.

### Hash Tables
- Implementation using chaining and open addressing methods.
- Operations: insert, delete, search.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

#### Bubble Sort
- Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- Best suited for small datasets.

#### Selection Sort
- Selection-based sorting algorithm.
- Efficient for small datasets.

#### Insertion Sort
- Comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- Efficient for partially sorted datasets.

#### Merge Sort
- Divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
- Efficient for large datasets.

#### Quick Sort
- Divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
- Generally faster than merge sort for large datasets.

### Searching

#### Linear Search
- Simple search algorithm.
- Best for unsorted datasets.

#### Binary Search
- Efficient search algorithm for sorted datasets.

### Graph Algorithms

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Graph traversal algorithm using a stack.

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Graph traversal algorithm using a queue.

### Dynamic Programming
- Implementation of popular dynamic programming problems like Fibonacci, Knapsack, and more.

### Recursion
- Implementation of recursive algorithms for common problems like factorial, Fibonacci, and tower of Hanoi.
